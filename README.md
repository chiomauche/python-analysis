# python-challange
This assignment includes two python challanges, PyBank and PyPoll. 
In the PyBank, we created a new file called main.py, and analyzed the financial records of a company. I created a python script that analyzed the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of the Profit/Losses, the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period and the average of the changes, the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in profits over the entire period.

In the PyPoll, I created a Python script that analyzed the votes of a particular county by calculating the total number of the votes cast, a complete list of the candidates who received votes, the percentage of the votes each candidate won, total number of votes each candidate won, the winner of the election based on popular vote.
